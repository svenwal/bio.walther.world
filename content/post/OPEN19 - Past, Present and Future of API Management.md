Traditional API Management is facing massive disruption due to emerging new technologies and development processes. In this session we are going to have a discussion on the concepts of traditional API Management from the SOA era, the current Microservices & DevOps revolution and arising patterns like Service Mesh.

We are going to work with the next generation Open Source gateway by Kong to see how to deploy in modern infrastructures like Docker, Kubernetes and OpenShift and how a lightweight configuration approach fits into CI/CD chains.
