As the upcoming 5G standard for mobile communications is heading to a modern, RESTful architecture my talk is about the best practices with those technologies (including OAuth, OpenID Connect and JOSE) since more than 10 years in the market.

Focus is on the lessons learned so telcos can leverage the knowledge already existing rather than (as in the past) developing their own protocols and security products / mechanisms.
