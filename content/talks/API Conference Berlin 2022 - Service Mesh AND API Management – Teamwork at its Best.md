When it comes to API Management and Service Meshes, they are often considered in an “or” (XOR) fashion, with Service Mesh being seen as the successor of gateways.

It has turned out in actual installations at scale that to provide the best infrastructure, they instead will work closely together in “and” (AND) fashion to bring together external and internal traffic.

We will talk about when to use which of the two patterns, how they can be set up as a team, and look at a live example of a typical microservices architecture being exposed to the customers. The talk will include an architectural overview, a live session using both Kong Gateway and Kong Mesh in a multi-cloud setup, and a Q&A session at the end.
